# Google Drive Api Connection
This is a simple project that i made to learn the basics concepts of Node and API's connections. 

# Before we start

First you need to create a Google Project and get your credentials to use Google's API.

To create a Project, Credentials and a OAuth Consent Screen you need to go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/home/">Google Console</a>.

For further information to can read the official documentation <a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project">Click here.</a>

# Installation

First, you need to clone the project on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mathz78/GoogleDriveAPIConnection.git 
```

After that you need to install node modules:

```
cd GoogleDriveAPIConnection/

npm install (or yarn install)
```

Then you need to copy the credentails.json generated by Google and paste it inside the public folder.

Now you just need to run the application! 

Inside the project's folder run: 
```
node .
```

# More information

Every time the user allows the application to use their Google Account it creates a token.json in te public folder, if you need to change the scopes of the application you need to delete the token.

Feel free to contribute with pull requests or issues, i'm learning it, so if you think that i can improve something just let me know!
